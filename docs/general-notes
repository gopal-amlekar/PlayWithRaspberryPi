# To schedule a job repetitively, use crontab -e. This opens up the crontab in edit mode.

# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line indicating with different fields when the task will be run and what command to run for the task
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon), and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# Use this MAILTO=username@domain.com in the crontab file. (With some changes, separate email address can also be specified for separate tasks.
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# m h  dom mon dow   command

# To see log of crontab, see the file /var/log/syslog. You can run GREP to see cron jobs run - GREP CRON /var/log/syslog
