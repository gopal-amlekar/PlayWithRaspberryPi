Just followed the tutorial on following link:
https://www.baldengineer.com/mqtt-tutorial.html

Did work well with the raspberry pi acting as server. Used Linux another machine as one more node and called the mqtt sub mqtt pub 
commands to pass on text messages.

I think the pubnub is more promising so instead of spending time on basic mqtt, I will go to pubnub.

Using mqtt in actual product needs your own server with all the protection, hackproofing etc.

Note: the following link by Nayan have some more information as well.
